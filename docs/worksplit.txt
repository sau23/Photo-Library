Work Split
Nick will work on the graphics for login display as well as the 
event-handling functions of the buttons in the admin user display 
and the non-admin user display. The graphics will be loosely based 
on the storyboard's depictions. The buttons in both the admin user 
display and the non-admin user display will prompt for user input as a 
means of confirmation. Nick will also work on the various classes required 
to hold the data needed to display to the screen, such as the album class and the photo class. 

Sam will work on the graphics for admin user display and the non-admin 
user display. These graphics will be loosely based on the storyboard's depictions. 
Sam will also work on the event-handling functions for the buttons and tabs in the 
non-admin user display. The tabs will represent albums and contain a listview that 
lists each photo contained in the selected album. The buttons will also prompt for
user input as a means of confirmation.
