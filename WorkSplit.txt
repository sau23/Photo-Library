Nick will also work on the various classes required to hold the data needed to display to the screen, such as the album class and the photo class. 

Sam will work on the graphics for admin user display and the non-admin user display. These graphics will be loosely based on the storyboard's depictions. Sam will also work on the event-handling functions for the buttons and tabs in the non-admin user display.
